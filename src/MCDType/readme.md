This package contains essentially table attributes type classes definitions 
such as : Increments, BigIncrement, Integer, String, .....

NB : The base class of all Attributes type is called TypeBase, so when you create new Type, 
you will need to inherit from this class and implements some interface based on the attribute Type characteristics.
